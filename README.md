# Bonanza Bot
 
This will be a basic Twitter bot to track the wearabouts of my fathers Aircraft. Why? You may be asking. Well, I'm bored and it sounds like fun to make a twitter bot and learn how to use some new API's.

This currently uses the OpenSky Network API to get aircraft information, LocationIQ API to do a reverse lookup on the aircrafts location, and Twitter API to make tweets.

### VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently a mass amount of incomplete code and no main file whatsoever. It's a bunch of pieces split into pieces that I still need to get put together.
