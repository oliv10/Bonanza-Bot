# Bonanza Bot
 
This will be a basic Twitter bot to track the wearabouts of my fathers Aircraft. Why? You may be asking. Well, I'm bored and it sounds like fun to make a twitter bot and learn how to use some new API's.

This currently uses the OpenSky Network API to get aircraft information, LocationIQ API to do a reverse lookup on the aircrafts location, and Twitter API to make tweets.

# VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS #
